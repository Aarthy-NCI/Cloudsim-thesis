# Cloudsim-thesis
Cloudsim Is a simulation tool to model, simulate and experiment on cloud computing infrastructures, which would otherwise be impossible in realtime testbeds to scale in large numbers. Its aimed at providing a generalized and extensible simulation framework allowing its users to focus on specific system design issues that they want to investigate, without getting concerned about the low level details related to Cloud-based infrastructures and services.

In this work we have built two algorithms to test the task scheduling feature in cloud environment.Following algorithms and its results are studied by help of this simulation model.

* Shortest Job First          `SJF.SJF_Scheduler`
* First Come First Serve      `FCFS.FCFS_Scheduler`
